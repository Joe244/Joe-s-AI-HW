As shown in Chaper 3.1, goals help organize behavior by limiting the objectives that the agent is trying to achieve and hence the actions it needs to consider. The goal formulation may based on the current situations and the human's performance measurance. So  without decisioning our problerms, we won't be able to check and figure out what is going to happen in the process and what algorithm fits them well. In that, making decision before goal formulations helps us to get useful and sufficient solutions."
